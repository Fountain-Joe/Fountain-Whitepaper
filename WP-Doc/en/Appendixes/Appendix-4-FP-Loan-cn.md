# Appendix 4: FP Loan
## Loan rules:
A can lend his FP to B in two ways:
- Floating profit loan:
A and B confirm the loan volume M, loan period N, proportion X%.
The loan should be completed within the validity period after the comfirmation. Then the M will be used to calcutlate the PoC revenue.
When calculating the PoC revenue, if the proportion between M and the amount of FP B used to participate in the PoC is T%, X% * T% of the reward B get will be distributed to A. The rest could be kept by B himself.
B doesn't have the ownership of M. When maturity date comes, the loan volume M will be automatically transfered to A.
- Fixed profite loan:
A and B confirm the loan volume M, loan period N, fixed profit Y.
B have to lock up Y amount of FP and be confirmed by A. Then the M will be used to calcutlate the PoC revenue.
B doesn't have the ownership of M. When maturity date comes, the loan volume M and the locked part Y will both be automatically transfered to A.
## Loan limitation:
- The amount A could lend to others can't exceed half of the FP he own.
- The amount A could borrow from the others can't exceed the upper limit Z.
